Through the first nine months, DAUs and revenue are \nboth up 40% or more compared to the same period last year, and we continue to expand profitability. In Q3, we \ncrossed an important milestone: more than 50 million people now use Duolingo every day. We also saw chess \nbecome our fastest-growing subject, had our biggest brand moment in Asia by partnering with Luckin Coffee, \nand launched a LinkedIn integration so learners can showcase their Duolingo Score. \nOver 26,000 Luckin stores in Asia partnered with us, selling more than 10 million Duolingo-branded drinks in two weeks.\nDAUs grew 36% year over year in Q3, even on top of an exceptional Q3 last year. Growth was slightly slower \nthan Q2 in part because we posted less \u201cunhinged\u201d content on our English-speaking social media accounts as \nwe listened to community feedback and prioritized building long-term brand sentiment. We recently started \nposting more unhinged content, and while impressions haven\u2019t yet reached peak volume, we\u2019ve seen a \nsignificant increase in them. We also modestly increased marketing spend to help drive momentum, \nparticularly in the US. These actions support near-term user growth, but long-term gains will come from \nmaking our product even more engaging and effective.\nTaking the long view\nOne of our five operating principles is \u201ctake the long view.\u201d The opportunity ahead of us is to teach billions of \npeople, and while we\u2019ve made incredible progress, we know we\u2019re early in our journey. \nWe focus on three core areas as we look to continuously improve our product: monetization, user growth, and \nteaching better across all our subjects. Each impacts our financial results on a different timeline. Monetization \nimprovements, such as getting more users to subscribe, show up immediately. User growth improvements \ntake longer to show up in our finances, since it takes time for people to subscribe. And teaching improvements \ntake the longest, since they take time to improve user growth, which in turn takes time to improve \nmonetization.\nDUOLINGO Q3 / FY 2025 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                  4\n",

      "text": "One of the most important parts of my job is balancing among these three core areas, both in terms of relative \ninvestment and navigating tradeoffs between them. For example, changes that boost subscriptions may have a \nnegative impact on free user growth, so we have to determine what tradeoff makes sense. \nIn Q3 we decided to shift the balance towards longer-term initiatives. In particular, we\u2019re investing \nproportionally more in teaching better, and we\u2019re prioritizing user growth over monetization in the A/B tests \nthat get launched. This shift is reflected in our full-year guidance. We\u2019re doing this now because we want to \nkeep growing users for a long time, and because of our increasing conviction that AI can fundamentally change \nwhat\u2019s possible in how we teach. If we develop an app that is more engaging than, and teaches as well as, a \npersonal tutor across multiple subjects, we think we\u2019ll become a much bigger business in the long-term.\nLooking ahead\nAs for Q4, I\u2019m excited about a number of product initiatives. We\u2019ve introduced player-vs-player on our chess \ncourse, a new flashcards exercise for better word memorization, and a new guided Video Call format that \nshould help increase Max adoption. Q4 also brings two of our biggest annual events: Year in Review and our \nNew Year\u2019s Promotion.

Total \nbookings grew 33% year over year, or 31% on a constant currency basis. Revenue grew 41% year over year, or \n42% on a constant currency basis. Net income benefited from the release of valuation allowance of certain \ndeferred tax assets of $222.7 million during the quarter. And we delivered record Adjusted EBITDA of $80.0 \nmillion, expanding year-over-year margin by almost five points to 29.5%.\nIn Q3, we delivered DAU growth of 36%, even while lapping a strong Q3 2024, which grew 54% year over year. \nWe also outperformed our expectations for bookings. We continue to see a mix shift toward our higher-priced \nsubscription tiers, including Max and our family plan, which drove a 7% year-over-year increase in subscription \nrevenue per average paid subscriber, or ARPU. \nGross margin declined about 40 basis points year over year to 72.5%, as a result of increases in generative AI \nand hosting costs. We also achieved operating leverage across both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses, \nwhich led to our highest ever quarterly Adjusted EBITDA.\nQ4 and FY 2025 Guidance\nDuolingo is providing the following guidance for the fourth quarter ending December\u00a031, 2025, and the full year \nending December 31, 2025(1).\n(in millions)\nQ4 2025\nFY 2025\nBookings\n$329.5 - $335.5\n$1,151 - $1,157\nYoY Bookings Growth\n21.3% - 23.5%\n32.2% - 32.9%\nRevenues\n$273 - $277\n$1,027.5 - $1,031.5\nYoY Revenue Growth\n30.3% - 32.2%\n37.4% - 37.9%\nAdjusted EBITDA (2)\n$75.4 - $78.8\n$296.9 - $300.2\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (2)\n27.6% - 28.4%\n28.9% - 29.1%\n(1)  Our guidance in the table above assumes foreign exchange rates as of October\u00a031, 2025. On a constant currency basis, assuming the \naverage foreign exchange rates for Q4 2024 remained constant for Q4 2025, we estimate our Q4 2025 year-over-year growth for \nbookings and revenue at 18.2% to 20.4% and 28.2% to 30.1%, respectively. On a constant currency basis, assuming the average \nforeign exchange rates for full-year 2024 remained constant for full-year 2025, we estimate our full-year 2025 year-over-year \ngrowth for bookings and revenue at 31.2% to 31.9% and 37.4% to 38.0%, respectively.\n(2)  With regards to the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin outlook provided above, a reconciliation to GAAP net \nincome, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, has not been provided as the \nquantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net income cannot be calculated or predicted at this time without \nunreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards \nrequires additional inputs such as number of shares granted and market price that are not currently ascertainable, and the non-\nGAAP adjustment for certain legal, tax and regulatory reserves and expenses depends on the timing and magnitude of these \nexpenses and cannot be accurately forecasted.

As a reminder, over half of our bookings \ncome from outside the US. So, every 1% change in the dollar versus our currency basket equates to \nabout a $1 million impact on bookings for the remainder of the year.\nGross margin\nWe expect FY 2025 gross margin to decline about 80 basis points year-over-year. This is a 20 basis points \nimprovement from the guidance we provided last quarter, which reflects lower-than-expected AI costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nBased on strong year-to-date top-line growth and continued cost discipline, we\u2019re raising our full-year Adjusted \nEBITDA margin guidance to 29.0% at the midpoint, representing an expansion of about 330 basis points over \nlast year and about 25 basis points above the midpoint of our previous guidance. This implies a full-year \nincremental margin of 37.9%, demonstrating our ability to deliver operating leverage even as we invest for \ngrowth.\nFor Q4, we are guiding to an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.0% at the midpoint, reflecting our continued \ninvestment in product-led AI initiatives and marketing.\nDUOLINGO Q3 / FY 2025 \n    \n \n \n           \n  \n \n                                                                                9\n",

The measurement period for MAUs is the three months ended \nSeptember\u00a030, 2025 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on \nthose periods. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Duolingo.\nDaily Active Users (DAUs). DAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the learning \nsection of our website each calendar day. DAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the average of the \nDAUs for each day in that measurement period. The measurement period for DAUs is the three months ended \nSeptember\u00a030, 2025 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on \nthose periods. DAUs are a measure of the consistent engagement of our global user community on Duolingo.\nPaid Subscribers. Paid subscribers are defined as users who pay for access to any Duolingo subscription offering \nand had an active subscription as of the end of the measurement period. Each unique user account is treated as a \nsingle paid subscriber regardless of whether such user purchases multiple subscriptions, and the count of paid \nsubscribers does not include users who are currently on a free trial or who are non-paying members of a family \nplan. \nSubscription Bookings and Total Bookings. Subscription bookings represent the amounts we receive from a \npurchase of any Duolingo subscription offering. Total bookings include subscription bookings, income from \nadvertising networks for advertisements served to our users, purchases of the Duolingo English Test, and in-app \npurchases of virtual goods. We believe bookings provide an indication of trends in our operating results, including \ncash flows, that are not necessarily reflected in our revenues because we recognize subscription revenues ratably \nover the lifetime of a subscription, the majority of which are twelve months in duration.\nLimitation of Key Operating Metrics and Other Data\nWe manage our business by tracking several operating metrics, including MAUs, DAUs, paid subscribers, and \nsubscription and total bookings. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our \nuser base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is \nused. These metrics are determined by using internal data gathered on an analytics platform that we developed and \noperate and have not been validated by an independent third party. This platform tracks user account and session \nactivity. If we fail to maintain an effective analytics platform, our metrics calculations may be inaccurate. We believe \nthat these metrics are reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, and that the \nmethodologies we employ and update from time-to-time to create these metrics are reasonable bases to identify \ntrends in user behavior. Because we update the methodologies we employ to create metrics, our operating metrics \nmay not be comparable to those in prior periods.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures \nfor financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. By \nexcluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that these non-\nGAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we \nbelieve these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional \ninformation with respect to financial measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making \nand they may be used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of \nour business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and \nthese non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, \nour financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may \ncalculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as \ncomparative measures. \nThe effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period \ncomparisons. We use non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues and bookings, which exclude the \nimpact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for financial and operational decision-making and as a \nmeans to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate \ncomparisons and better identify trends in our business. The impact of changes in foreign currency may vary \nsignificantly from period to period, and such changes generally are outside of the control of our management. We \ncalculate constant currency revenues by translating current period foreign currency revenues using prior-year \nexchange rates applied consistently over the full revenue recognition period. We calculate constant currency \nbookings by using current period foreign currency bookings and translating them to constant currency using prior \nyear comparable period exchange rates.

Beginning in Q3 2025, we expanded our Adjusted EBITDA definition \nto include integration costs related to acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a \npercentage of revenues. GAAP operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, \nand general and administrative expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses are defined as the respective GAAP \noperating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses related to \nequity awards, and, as applicable, transaction costs related to acquisitions and acquisition earn-out costs. \nThese non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our \nbusiness and we present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they are helpful in \nhighlighting trends in our operating results and that they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other \ninterested parties to evaluate companies in our industry.
